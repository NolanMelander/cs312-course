Second and third arguments are our **minVal** and **maxVal** respectively. Third argument is aperture_size. It is the size of Sobel kernel used for find image gradients. By default it is 3. Last argument is L2gradient which specifies the equation for finding gradient magnitude. If it is True, it uses the equation mentioned above which is more accurate, otherwise it uses this function: Edge\\_Gradient \\; (G) = |G_x| + |G_y|. By default, it is False.\n",
