    "All of the coding in CS312 will be implimented using Python version 3.  Python will be downloaded using the python package manager conda. (See the next section).  Here is the Python 3 [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) and [interactive Python tutorial](http://www.learnpython.org/).\n",

    "\n",
    "Conda is a python package manager.  Python and all of it's libraries can be difficult to manage (ie., updating a library can cause other libraries to fail).  We will be using a small or miniized version of conda called miniconda.  There is a full version called Anaconda.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Download miniconda at [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html).  We need the 64 bit version.\n",

    "All of the course matterial and assignments are written in [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/).  Jupyter notebooks can be viewed directly in GitHub (such as this page).  For the course team activities and assignments, you will be required to be able to modfiy notebooks.  The above steps for Conda installed all of the software that you require.\n",

    "1. Type \"**jupyter notebook**\"\n",
    "1. A page will be displayed in your computer's Internet browser.  This is the main page of Jupyter.\n",
    "1. When you finished running notebooks, you will need to stop the engine by pressing Ctrl-C twice in the anaconda prompt terminal.\n",
